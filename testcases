A test case example in software testing includes a unique ID, a description of what is being tested, preconditions, test steps, expected results, and actual results. A test case is a specific instance of a test scenario, providing detailed instructions for executing a test. 
Here's a breakdown with an example:
Test Case Example: Login Functionality
Test Case ID: TC-LOGIN-001 
Test Scenario: Verify user login with valid credentials 
Description: This test case verifies that a user can successfully log into the application using valid username and password. 
Preconditions: The user must have a registered account with valid credentials. 
Test Steps:
Navigate to the login page. 
Enter the valid username in the username field. 
Enter the corresponding password in the password field. 
Click the "Login" button. 
Expected Result: The user is successfully logged in and redirected to the application's home page or dashboard. 
Actual Result: (To be filled in after test execution) 
Status: (Pass/Fail, to be filled in after execution) 
Key elements of a good test case:
Clear and concise: The test case should be easy to understand and follow. 
Reproducible: Anyone should be able to execute the test case and get the same results. 
Specific: Each step should have a clear and unambiguous action. 
Measurable: The expected result should be quantifiable or verifiable. 
Complete: The test case should cover all aspects of the functionality being tested. 
Test cases are essential for ensuring software quality by providing a structured and repeatable way to verify that the application meets the requirements and behaves as expected. They can be manual or automated, and their effectiveness depends on the quality of the test case design and execution.
